    <p id="intro"> I’m in this unique position where I have a huge 
      personal brand that follows me for interest in startup, and 
      I’m at the best tech school in the world surrounded by tech 
      nerds, and I was wondering should I be aiming for big tech 
      just to get that initial credibility as like a CTO under my 
      belt, or should I just full send building my own projects instead.</p>
